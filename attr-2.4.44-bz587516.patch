+Specifies the new value of the extended attribute. There are three methods
+available for encoding the value.  If the given string is enclosed in double
+quotes, the inner string is treated as text. In that case, backslashes and
+double quotes have special meanings and need to be escaped by a preceding
+backslash. Any control characters can be encoded as a backslash followed by
+three digits as its ASCII code in octal. If the given string begins with 0x or
+0X, it expresses a hexadecimal number. If the given string begins with 0s or
+0S, base64 encoding is expected.  See also the \-\-encoding option of
+getfattr(1).

 Remove the named extended attribute entirely.
